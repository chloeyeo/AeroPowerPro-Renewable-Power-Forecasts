# School of Maths & Stats - Renewable power forecasts

## Full Title 
Renewable power forecasts for public information and research - supporting decarbonisation reduction by connecting
open data sources

## Project Outline
This software should retrieve historic and live data from weather forecast providers, the Great Britain electricity transmission system operator (National Grid ESO) and potentially others. This data should be processed,  combined, and visualised to produce regional forecasts of wind and solar power production to enable electricity consumers to plan their usage to minimise carbon emissions and potentially save money. Visualisation should be accessible, e.g. via web browser or mobile app. The data gathered should be stored to allow past event to be analysed and for development of additional capabilities in the future.

### Plans to sustain project 
If successful, Dr. Browell would hope to continue to operate and develop the system with the support of students and staff in my group
