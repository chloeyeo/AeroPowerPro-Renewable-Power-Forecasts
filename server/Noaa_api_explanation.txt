How to understand cdf data.

Data is given as a list of arrays
The first and last elements(arrays) of the list correspond to requested data.
Each other element(array) corresponds to one data type. e.g. time, Altitude above msl, long, lat...

First and last arrays are shaped in such a way that:
    Each dimension acts as an index for the other arrays. e.g. u[0] would be the data for the first time
    u[0][0] would be the data for the first time and first Altitude above msl 
    etc...
